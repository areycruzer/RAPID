{"input": "9-1-1, what's your emergency? Representative Bogdanov, you're on deck. Representative Domino is here to talk about emergency dispatchers, 911 dispatchers. Welcome to the Health Care Council. You're recognized. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members. This bill upon passage will allow for a certification process for emergency dispatchers. Currently, 31 other states have such a process. It will recognize a 208-hour DOE-approved course as a minimum standard. The goal is to ensure that first responders are dispatched to emergencies and catastrophic events with a higher level of quality, efficiency, and minimized human errors. Our emergency dispatchers do a great job, but having all 67 counties follow the same standards will be helpful. We have some dramatic testimonies to support the need for this legislation. Very good. Are there any questions for Representative Domino on the bill? Let's go to public testimony. Representative Domino, do you want to call folks in a particular order? No particular order. Very good. Randy Touchton, you are up. Thank you. Florida Professional Firefighters Association waves in support. Armand Nalt, please come up. Thank you. Firefighters and paramedics from Palm Beach County support this bill. Gary Rainey, you're next. Thank you. From Miami, Florida, representing the Florida professional firefighters. Lisa Henning, please come forwards. I am with the Fraternal Order of Police here in Tallahassee, and I support this bill. Richard Goff, you're next. Good morning. My name is Richard Goff, a 25-year law enforcement veteran and father of Denise Lee. My daughter was kidnapped, raped, and murdered. The culprit drove her around, and she managed to get the attention of a bystander who called 911. The bystander gave a description of the car and the suspect, but our dispatch failed to relay this information to the road deputies. We had over six agencies, two helicopters, and approximately 30 people looking for her. She was found later buried in a shallow grave. The internal investigation found fault with two dispatchers, but the consequences were minor. I urge you to pass this bill. Thank you, Mr. Goff. Our hearts go out to you and your family. Amy Campbell, you're next. I am from Orlando, Florida, representing the Orange County Sheriff's Office, and I wave in support. Richard Pinsky, please come forwards. I am from West Palm Beach and represent 911 emergency dispatchers. I support this bill. Is there anyone else wishing to testify on House Bill 997? We'll now move into debate. Representative Hayes, you are recognized. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am deeply disturbed that this is only voluntary certification. We should look into making this mandatory in the future. We need our 911 operators to be properly trained and certified. I support this bill, but it should go further. Representative Harrell, you are recognized. Thank you. My heart goes out to the Goff family. The importance of training for dispatchers in both health care and law enforcement cannot be overstated. Often, 911 calls are health-related, and those dispatchers need appropriate training. This should be the standard across the state and be required. Representative Hudson, you are recognized. Thank you, Chairman. As a parent, I am speechless at Mr. Goff's testimony. Consistency in process is crucial across all counties to ensure quality information is disseminated efficiently. Our first responders deserve the best support. I support this bill. Representative Anderson, you are recognized. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I compliment Representative Domino for bringing this important bill forward. Communication and proper training are essential. I agree that this certification should eventually be mandatory. Representative Domino, would you like to close? Thank you. As mentioned, 28 states have mandatory certification, and some have voluntary. We have to start somewhere. This bill will save lives and significantly help in emergency situations. I urge your support. Thank you, Representative Domino. The clerk will now call the roll on House Bill 997. House Bill 997 will be reported favorably as a council substitute.

Okay, do you want to try to follow him? I don't know if I can catch up. There's a lot of traffic and I can't get over. The child was screaming, like a 'get me out of here' scream.

There's a towel around her ankles, and there's blood at her head. She was going to stay up until midnight to ring her grandmother's bell for the 4th of July, so I know she would have been awake.

Can you give me some more details about why you believe she's missing? She supposedly went for a run this morning at 7 o'clock in Lockmere, but no one has heard from her. She was supposed to be at my house at 8, and she never showed up. Have you checked with any local hospitals or anyone she might have contacted? I called Wake Med, and they haven't admitted her on any emergent basis. Okay. Just a moment. May I place you on hold for just a moment? Yep. Thank you. That's correct. All right. What is your friend's name? Her name is Nancy Cooper. What is her address? She and her husband live together, but they are in the middle of a divorce. Have you tried making contact with her? Yes, I called her husband this morning around 9. He said she went for a run with her friend Carrie, but she hasn't returned. I'm worried because it's not like her to disappear like this. Has her husband been violent with her in the past? I'm not sure if he's been physically violent, but I know there's been a lot of tension. Is it possible she might have done something else and just forgotten to inform anyone? Her car is parked at home and her cell phone is there, so it seems like she did leave for a run. It's not like her to just vanish without letting anyone know. Did her husband mention anything about her running with someone else? Yes, he said she was running with a friend named Carrie, but none of her other friends or I knew anything about it. It's very odd. What can the police department do to help in this situation? I'm not sure what to do. Should her husband be the one to file a report? Is there a certain number of hours we need to wait? There is no time limit to file a missing person report. The person who last saw her should file it, which in this case would be her husband. Okay. I'm just worried about how her husband will react. It's better to be safe than sorry. We will send an officer to her house to speak with her husband and check the area. Thank you. Her husband contacted me directly to explain the situation. We will also check the trails around Lockmere Lake. Can you describe the trails she might have taken? Yes, they're public trails, but some parts are more secluded. I've run with her there before.

I had a student that had withdrawn from the program. She came to me earlier looking for help. I sent her to get her transcripts, then she went to someone else's office, and then she came back to my office. I asked her to take a seat for a minute until I could finish the tests, and then she just started shooting. I hit the ground, and when I turned around, everyone else hit the ground with me.

{"input": "9-1-1, what's your emergency? I robbed somebody downtown Portland at 9th Point. And I just wanted to let you guys know that I did that. I'm not going to commit suicide. I'm standing on a 10-story high building. Okay, where are you? I don't want to release that information. I just wanted to let you guys know that it was me. You're not going to tell me where you are. Why are you calling me? Because I'd like to let you guys know that I committed a robbery, and I plan to end my life soon. What's your name? Brad Morgan. Is there anyone we should call and let know? I'd like you to contact Karina Bartley, but it's up to you guys. Do you have a phone number for this person? She won't answer the phone, but I've been trying to contact her. Who is this person to you? She's my ex-girlfriend. How long ago did she become your ex-girlfriend? About three weeks ago. And you're going to jump off the building because of that or some other reason? I've gotten myself into a lot of trouble lately. My girlfriend took my son from me and denied my visiting time. I tried to go through the courts to work things out, but my life is just in a bad place, so I feel that I no longer need to live. And that's your final decision? There's no way I can talk you out of that? No. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up about what's going on. Okay, tell me her name again. I didn't catch it. Karina Bartley. What's your phone number? Hold on one second. It's 503-839-3689. This is the ex-girlfriend who's the mother of your child? Yeah. How old is your child? He's eight months old. It's too bad that you're not going to get to see him and talk to him when he's older, don't you think? I'd be in jail if I went back to see him anyway. Don't you think you'd still prefer to be alive so he has a dad? He probably would, but I'm not thinking about that right now. How did you get up to the building? Did you walk or drive? I don't have a vehicle, so I walked. Okay. Are you on top of a business or a parking structure? It's a parking structure. I can see Pioneer Square from here. Can you talk to me a little bit longer before you do anything you can't take back? I know I cant take it back once I do it, and I'm really debating on whether to do it or not. I'm going to give you a really great deal. Are you ready for it? What? This is a one-time-only deal, and only from me. I will believe everything you tell me on this phone call. Everything. You have my word. Okay. So, talk to someone who is prepared to believe you. Tell me your side. The reason why my girlfriend broke up with me is because we got into a little argument. She told the police officer that I hung up the phone while she was trying to make a police report, and that's why I got arrested. I sat in jail for four days and got a restraining order while I was in there. Was that a long time ago? No, just recently. And the cops didn't believe you because of your record? Yes. That's why I went to jail. You tell me what really happened. I was trying to leave with my son. She took my son from me, so I took him back and pushed her left arm at the door because she was trying to hold me in our apartment. Not like shoved her, but I put my hand on the door knob and elbowed her away a little. Then I started proceeding down to the max to get on the Max to go see my parents. She flagged down the sheriff who was driving by. She gave him her side of the story, and I gave him mine. He arrested me because I hung up the police call. I understand that was a bad thing at the time, but it got me arrested and made it so I couldn't see my son either longer than I was supposed to. After that, my girlfriend says I can call and talk to my son. When I call, she calls the police and says I'm contacting her, and now they want to arrest me for that. Was there a no-contact order? Yes. And then she called the police when you did? Yes. I just feel like I no longer need to live. She's just putting me down every which way. I have nobody besides her. Hang on a second. Did the initial call and the no-contact order come from the judge after the hang-up incident? It came from the judge, yes. That's a temporary thing for now. Thats not an irrevocable decision. You have to work through the system and wait it out. The problem is that I've been in the system my whole life, and I'm tired of it. Its like I've been constantly trying to get out from under a dark cloud. Doing bad things doesn't define you forever. You learn from mistakes and become a better person because of it. Ending your life is cheating. You get to grow beyond your past. I appreciate the sweet talk. I really do. It feels good to talk to someone. I'm not just trying to make you feel better. Everyone deals with consequences, but you get to choose to become better. Youre not stuck where you are. When I try to be better, things just fall apart and crash back down on me. Have you tried to get help? You said you've been working with the system for a long time. I have a criminal background. I've been with the wrong crowd, done the wrong things. Admitting to making bad choices is excellent, but you dont have to stay there. You get to choose to be different. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm choosing to end it. Everyone dies. That doesn't make you different. You want to be a better man, not just a dead man. Your son needs you to be the better man. The reason why I'm really mad is she's posting on Facebook, making it visible to me, showing she's with another guy. I feel like she orchestrated this. Plus, I took care of my son the first eight months, and now she's claiming him on her taxes. It sounds like you're not getting a fair deal, but removing yourself from the situation doesn't hurt her. Youre punishing yourself for what she did. Don't do that. I was a part of this. I made mistakes too. She even got my cousin against me. The cops are always on her side. It seems like you have tried to work things out, but have you sought out help from professionals? I've been fighting the courts and police my whole life. I'm tired of it. I feel like shooting one of them right now. Please don't do that. The police in the area want to help you. They dont want to see you dead on the pavement. Can you tell me what you're wearing so they can find you? I'm wearing a red backpack and a black hoodie with red on it. Do you have any weapons on you? Possibly. I'm just going to let them know what youve said. They want to help you, not hurt you. I'd actually prefer for a police officer to shoot me. But I don't want to go back to that jailhouse again and be treated like a rag doll. They don't want to shoot you, Brad. Thats not what they want to do. I feel like they do. I've been beaten by nightsticks and maced. Theyve bruised me. They do not want to kill you. They want to ensure your safety, just like I do. Police are circling the building. They don't know how to get in. I walked up the stairs from the Max. It's easy to clean up. Please, don't do anything rash. I know you're feeling trapped, but hurting yourself isn't the answer. I'm a good person. My girlfriend keeps hurting me. You said she's posting on Facebook. How do you know? I have friends on her Facebook. They show me. I understand that must hurt, but there are ways to work through this. She even wrote on Facebook, 'I'm done with you. Leave me alone.' I thought we were in this together. That's really tough. Is she older than you? No, she's younger. She's playing with your emotions, but hurting yourself isn't the way to stop her. The police have found me. Would you do me a huge favor? Please don't do anything rash. Put your hands up and go talk to them. Let them help you. Alright, I'm cool with that. Please, just go to them and let them help you. I'm not going to the police. I'm not going back to that jailhouse. You're not doing anything wrong tonight. Your safety is the priority. Cops won't be able to reach me. I got to a place they cannot. They want to help you. Nobody wants to see you hurt. I've never seen it before, but I imagine its quick and painless. It's not. I promise you. Its painful for everyone involved. The police are talking to me. Ill let you go. Please remember, there are people who care about you. Let them help.", "output": "Location: 9th point\nCategory: police\nSeverity: high\nRecommended Action: Dispatch armed police units immediately"}

Is there any serious bleeding? Yes, severe bleeding. Are you with her right now? I am, we're in close proximity to where it happened. What kind of injuries does she have? It's hard to tell, it's dark, and I dropped my bike down the trail. I don't have a light. Is the animal still nearby? Not that I know of. I hope it's gone away. How far are you from Campbell Airstrip Road? If you came up Campbell-Airstrip Road, you would access us by the South Bivouac Trailhead. Sir, listen, we understand. How far in are you, about a quarter mile? Yes, we're going to come in off the South Bivouac Trailhead. Okay. Our first caller gave us that information and is waiting there for us.

Okay, thank you. Does she have any serious bleeding? Yes, I would say so. What I want you to do is get a clean, dry cloth or towel, place it on the wound, and press it down firmly without lifting it up to look. I don't know exactly where the wound is, that's the problem. Can you ask her where she thinks she's hurt? Do you know where you're hurt? Sir, listen, I have a quick question. How close are you to the Campbell Airstrip? We are farther than the actual airstrip. They need to go farther up the road. How far up the road from the Campbell Airstrip? I would say a mile and a half, two miles. There will be two obvious trailheads with big wooden signs. So they're marked north and south? Yes, they want to go into South Bivouac Trailhead. Once they get to the South Bivouac parking lot, they're going to go down the trail and look to the right for a steep dirt trail? Yes, it leads to a footbridge that crosses the creek, then take a right onto the trail. They should have bear protection. We're getting the cops to come out there with us. Okay, you're doing great. Just hang in there. Is the bear still there? Not that I know of, but it's dark. Do you know what kind of bear it was? I don't know. Just stay awake and stay alert. Is she breathing regularly?

Let me know if anything changes. Hey, can you stop, please? We have a bear attack. The paramedics are coming to South Bivouac Trailhead. You're doing awesome. Just keep calm. Okay, a biker is going up to direct them down to us. Great. How is she doing? She seems to be doing okay, still conscious and able to move a bit. Okay, just keep her still, we don't want her moving around. I had to move her a bit from the attack spot but will keep her still now. You're doing great. Do you know how far up Campbell Airstrip Road the trailhead is? About a mile and a half to two miles. If they start going uphill, they've gone past it. We've got officers escorting the medics in right now. Good, that should help. We've got another biker arriving. Is that another biker? Yes, they are here to help with flagging down the paramedics. Great. Just keep her as still as possible. We have an EMT here now who's assessing her injuries. That's good. What injuries can you identify now? A puncture wound to the face and some trauma to the inner thigh. Can you keep a clean, dry cloth on the wound with pressure? The EMT is handling it. The wounds don't seem to be bleeding too badly. Okay, good. Just keep her calm and still. She's doing okay, breathing more steadily now. Let me know if anything changes with her condition. Will do. There seems to be another wound on her back, above her left buttock. Okay, just make sure she stays still. She's doing great. The medics should be here soon. You're doing a great job. Can you see if the bear did any other damage? It's hard to tell, but it looks like a puncture wound to her throat area. We need to assure her that help is on the way. She knows, she's just trying to stay calm. The medics should be here anytime now. Okay, let me know when they arrive. Will do. Are you still there? Yes, the medics have arrived with the police.

It's been about 22 minutes on the drawbridge, and I'm in the front car, and I can see something happening on the bridge. Sir, what's your complaint? What exactly is the issue you're calling about?

The light is red, there's a drop gate with six blinking lights, but no bridge going up. Did you call 911 just to report this issue? Yes. Okay, well, the person you spoke to before was trying to explain that 911 is for emergencies only, not for traffic issues. No, but this isn't just traffic.

We can't help with traffic signals or bridge malfunctions. I live in Alexandria, but I'm not even on the Alexandria side right now. I understand.
